From first look to first step, the ISPA MindBody is the new definition of R&R. The inviting and pillowy foam midsole is an oasis of sensations, while its light and airy Flyknit upper provides a sanctuary you won't want to step away from. Guided by Nike's circular design philosophy, a key feature to this concept is designing with product end of life in mind, which resulted in shoes that can be easily disassembled. No glue necessary\u2014just a single cording system that holds it all together. When you're done with your shoes, there's no need to take them apart or throw them away. Simply drop 'em off at a participating Nike store and they'll be given a new life through donation or recycling.", "colour": "Barely Volt/Volt/Smokey Mauve/Flat Pewter", "url": "https://www.nike.com/id/t/ispa-mindbody-shoes-9ZntBr/DH7546-700", "img_url": "https://static.nike.com/a/images/t_PDP_144_v1/f_auto/f812df94-59e4-4d86-baf8-3d153095576c/ispa-mindbody-shoes-9ZntBr.png"}, {"id": "DX5883-100", "title": "Nike Air Force 1 '07 EasyOn", "category": "Women's Shoes", "price (RP)": "1,729,000", "description": "Quicker than 1, 2, 3\u2014the original hoops shoe lets you step in and get going.
